# Simple HTML online Presentation template

## What is this for a presentation template?
This is a template for a web presentation. This project will meet your expectiations if you are searching on "_How to create an online presentation without using any kind of framework_".
For this template I only used basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript so it should be very self explaining. Feel free to download it!
But one more thing: **You should know the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript** to understand how it works to able to customize it for your requirements.

## How to use this template?
As already mentioned, you should know the basics of this scripts and languages to be able to use this template the proper way.
To start the presentation just open it (after you downloaded and unpacked it). Then just click on the _start_ button and never touch the mouse again (if you do so and click somewhere, the presentation won't work anymore => this caused due to the way the logic of the presentation is implemented). After that just tap any key on your keyboard except of the _F-Keys_ or _Space_ (this would cause an unintended behaviour).

## Why an online presentation?
If you were searching for this kind of topic before, you can skip this part. But for anyone else:
The primary advantage of a presentation like this is that it is in a web format, so you are able to open it with almost any computer or device, because almost every device supports the basic web formats (the only critical thing is JavaScript). Another advantage is that you are able to host it on a web host service. So you are even able to access it from anywhere as long as you have a stable wifi connection.
I built this template because I had to hold a presentation in school, but the PCs had a weird format when other people held their presentations or just didn't work at all. So I thought it would be a better way (and a much more cool way) to just write my own presentation template, which worked out pretty good in my opinion. And another thing is that I forget a lot things very quickly, so the idea of hosting this presentation on the the web was the solution to this problem.
And one last thing: You can even change the CSS of this project to customize it for different kinds of display sizes with RWD. I think this is a thing which isn't even possible with the other established presentation applications (they can do this but it does weird stuff if you open it on different kinds of display sizes, if you have done something with CSS in the past you will know what I mean).


I hope I was able to help you. I searched for something like this before, but I wasn't able to find something in this direction.
