# Simple HTML Presentation template

## What is this?
This is a template for a web presentation. The project will fully meet your expections if you search for "_How to create a online presentation without using any kind of framework_". I only used basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this presentation. Feel free to download it. 
But one last thing: **You should know the basics of HTML, CSS and JS** if you want to customize it for your requirements.

## How to use it
As already told you should know the basics of the mentioned above scripts and languages.
To start the presentation, just open it. Then you just have to click on start and never touch the mouse anymore (if you click on the mouse, the presentation won't work anymore). After that you just have to tap any key on your keyboard except of the _F-Keys_ and _Space_.


I hope that I can help if that template. I searched for something like that but couldn't find anything in that direction
